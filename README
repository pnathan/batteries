My personal library.

Batteries "energizes" my Lisp development.

Particularly handy for me is the DEFOBJECT macro. It wraps a DEFCLASS declaration and creates a make-objectname function. 
It approximates a DEFSTRUCT semantic, but generates CLOS classes instead. I like it when I want a bog-standard 
C++-y class.

Licenses are popular to have on source code. :-) 
This license is AGPL 3.0.  That's very restrictive. If you *really* need it to be another license, 
pnathan@vandals.uidaho.edu is my email.

HTH.
